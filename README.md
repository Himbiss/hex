# hex
An implementation of the game Hex using phaser.io and eureca.io

The game was invented by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein in 1942.
Hex is a strategy board game played on a hexagonal grid.
The goal for each player is to form a connected path of their own stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colors, before their opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion.

This particular implementation was realized with phaser.io and eureca.io.
You can play it online against other players here: http://www.hex.himbiss.de
